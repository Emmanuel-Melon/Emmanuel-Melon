<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Emmanuel Gatwech 🐞</h1>

**Software Engineer from South Sudan | Currently based in Rwanda**

Building human-centered systems at the intersection of engineering and cognitive science.

## Personal Thesis: The Cognitive Foundation

My engineering philosophy, [https://github.com/Emmanuel-Melon/human-centered-engineering] (Human-Centered-Engineering) (HCE), is inspired by studying the **evolutionary roots of systems thinking**. This research is supported by a formal study in **Neuroscience at Arizona State University**, which showed me that the most successful systems are those optimized for our innate human and organizational constraints. I translate this understanding into technical architecture.

### Current Focus
- **Founding Engineer @ [Redacted]**: Architected the distributed media processing pipeline, reducing transcription-to-analysis latency, and implementing AI-powered semantic search.
- **Human-Centered Engineering Framework** Formalizing my framework for translating cognitive and social constraints into system design patterns and organizational strategy.

## Stack & Architecture

**TypeScript • Rust • React • PostgreSQL • MongoDB • Redis**
Event-driven architecture • Real-time systems • Media processing • GraphQL • Docker

## Beyond the Code

* **Academic:** Formal studies in Computational Neuroscience inform my work on **defensive system architecture** (engineering for human "bad days").
* **Creative:** Writing under "The Silent Narrator," crafting stories that reflect my fascination with the underlying rhythms of human systems and behavior.
* **Impact:** Focused on leveraging thoughtful engineering to address complex challenges and create **sustainable opportunities across Africa.**
